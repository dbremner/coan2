<p class="section">Integration & Test Consultant, Ideaworkds3D, London: Sept 2011 - Dec 2011</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hired as process improvement consulant to introduce mature models and practices for codeline integration and testing in a small, fast growing
development business making the <a href="http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/">Marmalade SDK</a> for cross-platform mobile application
development in C++.
</li>
</ul>
 
<p class="section">Break: Dec 2010 - Sept 2011</p>
<ul>
<li>
Made redundant in Jan. 2011 with the demise of the <a ref="http://www.symbian.org/">Symbian Foundation</a> and took a
gap-spell for open-source activities, study and self-indulgence.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="section">Test Lead, Symbian Foundation, London: April 2009 - Dec 2010</p>
<ul>
<li>
Managed and led the team that integrated, developed and operated the Symbian Foundation's testing and Quality
Assurance capabilities, supporting and supported by the Symbian community.
</li>
<li>
Alongside my day-job, I did most of the kernel-hacking work on the Foundation's "GCC Surge" initiative, a push to port
the core Symbian OS to the open-source
<a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/sgpp?gclid=CKPgyLGA_aQCFWIA4wodMDWohA">ARM GCC toolchain</a>.  
Windows and Linux based development mainly in C++ with ARM assembler parts</li>
<li>
Also for the GCC Surge initiative, I ported a servicable subset of the Symbian build tools from Windows to Linux and likewise
ported the Symbian QEMU virtual machine manager, making it
possible for the first time to build the Symbian OS kernel on Linux and boot a Symbian VM on Linux. Linux based development in C++, perl, python, bash, GNU Make and XML.   
</li>
</ul>

<p class="section">Technical Team Leader, Developer Build & Test, Nokia, London: Jan 2008 - April 2009</p>
<p>Technical leader of the team that developed, maintained and ran the automated build and test service for Nokia's
Symbian OS development teams globally. The service ran on Windows clients and Linux servers and was implemented in Perl, C and Web technology.
<p class="section">Technical Team Leader, Developer Build & Test, Symbian Software Ltd, London: May 2005 - Jan 2008</p>
<p>The same job as the one above, before Nokia's acquisition of Symbian Software Ltd.</a></p>   

<p class="section">Integration, Engineer, Symbian Software Ltd., London: August 2002 - May 2005</p>
<p>"Founder member" of the Integration team in Symbian Software Ltd., putting the pieces together to make Symbian OS. Member of a small team
controlling the integration of development commits to the OS mainline to execute release integration plans; responsible for mainline
correctness and stability and for "CSI" of mainline breakage or regression.</p>
   
<p class="section">Consultant Porting Engineer, Systems Union, Farnborough UK: June 2001 - July 2002</p>
<p>Contracted to port Systems Union's enterprise finanical management solution, SunSystems, from MS Windows to Unix. Windows and Linux based development
in C++ with STL. My solution took the form of a POSIX compliant cross-platform OS abstraction layer targetable to Windows and *nix hosts upon which SunSystems
could be built for each host OS.</p>   

<p class="section">Consultant Unix Software Engineer, BT, Bracknell UK: January 2001 - June 2001</p>
<p>Contracted to rewrite the Solaris server daemon that supported BT's Directory Enquiries service. Windows and Solaris based development in
C++ with STL. An infrastructure consolidation programme called for a single national directory enquiries server to replace 44 regional ones
without deterioration of response. I achieved this by a speed-optimised redesign, employing much faster accessed data structures
and a multi-threaded server architecture in place of a slow forking one.</p>   


<p class="section">Consultant Windows System Engineer, Research Machines PLC, Oxfordshire UK: June 2000 - December 2000</p>
<p>Contracted to implement security customisations for the company's Windows NT classroom workstation system. I identified a fully satisfactory
3rd party solution that eliminated the need for me to write one. Research machines licensed this solution. For the remainder of
my contract I was employed developing user-management features in ActiveDirectory, BIOS security features in C and a template framework for
Windows services in C++.</p>
