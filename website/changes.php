<ul>
<li><b>DEF0117:</b> Diagnostics that cited an input line in its supposedly 
original form did not include any extensions of the line after a 
line-continuation.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0118:</b> The <span class="code">--filter</span> option was broken for filenames that include 
multiple '.', by seeking to match extensions from the first '.' in the leafname
rather than the last. Thus <span class="code">--filter cpp</span> would fail to match a filename <span class="code">a.b.cpp</span>.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0119:</b> The comma-operator was not accepted in preprocessor expressions.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0120:</b> Macro expansion was broken when arguments shadow formal 
parameters. Macro-expansion has been re-written from scratch.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0121:</b> False positives for circular symbol definitions. A function-like
macro that invoked with an argument that is another call to the same macro was 
falsely diagnosed as having a circular definition. Fixed in macro-expansion re-write.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0122:</b> Ternary conditional expressions were not simplified when they 
could be.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0123:</b> Ill-formed expressions provoked diagnostics only in the 
`source` command. The other the other commands correctly evaluated them
as insoluble but do not diagnose them.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0124:</b> Diagnostics may truncate a cited input line. Diagnostics that 
cited an input line in its supposedly original form did not include any 
extensions of the line after a line-continuation.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0125:</b> The associativity of arithmetic operators was wrongly 
right-to-left, not left-to-right, so an arithmetic expression in three 
or more unparenthisized operands of co-precedent operators was wrongly 
calculated, e.g. 2-21-21 as 2 instead of -40.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0126:</b> Garbage in <span class="code">#if/â€‹#elif</span> not an error. Coan issues a warning if 
excess tokens follow a directive. Where the directive is <span class="code">#if or #elif</span> 
the argument must be an expression, so an error should be diagnosed.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0127:</b> Macro calls to unconfigured symbols not diagnosed. A 
function-like macro call e.g. <span class="code">FOO(x)</span> with <span class="code">FOO</span> not a configured symbol 
was not diagnosed. The call was silently unresolved.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0128:</b> Evaluation of a character literal was skipped when it was the 
very first token in a directive argument
</li>
<li><b>DEF0129:</b> C++11 character literal prefixes 'u' and 'U' were not recognized.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0130:</b> UCN character literals, e.g. <span class="code">\u89AB,\U6789ABCD</span> were not 
recognized and cause a knock-on parsing bug by leaving the parser in a
false "in-quotation"-state after the end of the UCN literal.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0131:</b> Coan fails to allow the expansion of a macro argument to a 
system-include name or quoted string, thus faulting a valid macro call 
such a <span class="code">HAS_INCLUDE(<string>)</span> or <span class="code">HAS_INCLUDE("string")</span>
</li>
<li><b>TST0007:</b> The test suite is migrated from perl to python.
</li>
<li><b>TST0008:</b> The test suite is migrated from the autotools serial harness to the
parallel harness.
</li>
<li><b>REW0018:</b> <span class="code">--explain</span> option reworked. The <span class="code">--explain</span> option of the 
<span class="code">symbols</span> command is re-thought to show much more clearly and concisely 
the derivation of each macro expansion. It now reports successive steps 
of macro replacement for the explained invocation rather than 
recursively reporting the "most resolved form" of each macro invocation
in the expained invocation.
</li>
<li><b>REW0019:</b> Reporting for the <span class="code">symbols</span> command now always reports the 
provenance of a reported symbol: configured global, configured transient
or unconfigured.
</li>
<li><b>REW0020:</b> The <span class="code">--once</span> option is removed and replaced by two new options
<span class="code">--once-only</span> and <span class="code">--once-per-file</span>. The former is equivalent to the 
old <span class="code">--once</span>. The latter causes each distinct reported item to be 
reported just once per input file.
</li>
<li><b>REW0021:</b> Lexical scanning and expression parsing are re-written more 
efficiently, with the result that coan 6.0 processes files on average 
about twice as fast as coan 5.2
</li>
<li><b>REW0022:</b> Coan 6.0 is written entirely to the C++11 standard. Preprocessor
differentiation to support compiler versions that lag the standard is
removed and distro-versions that ship such compiler versions are not
supported.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0033:</b> The <span class="code">--evalsyms</span> option of the <span class="code">symbols</span> command is removed 
and replaced with the <span class="code">--expand</span> option. <span class="code">--evalsyms</span> reported the 
"most resolved form" of a symbol invocation, which was of little 
investigative use. <span class="code">--expand</span> reports the full macro expansion of a 
symbol invocation, and the integer to which it evaluates, if any.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0034:</b> The new command <span class="code">lines</span> is added, which causes coan to report 
<span class="code">#line</span>  directives. A corresponding option <span class="code">--lns</span> is provided for the 
`symbols` command, causing coan to consider only <span class="code">#line</span> directives for
reporting symbols.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0035:</b> The alternative operator keywords, <span class="code">and</span>, <span class="code">or</span>, <span class="code">not</span>, etc. are
now supported.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0036:</b> Coan now issues an informational diagnostic whenever a
<span class="code">#define</span> or <span class="code">#undef</span> retrospectively affects the meaning of previously
defined symbols.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>DEF0110:</b> Coan deleted indentation from simplified directives
</li> 
<li><b>DEF0111:</b> UTF-8 encodings of 4 bytes were not identified.
<li><b>DEF0112:</b> The output of the <span class="code">symbols</span> command 
with option <span class="code">--evalsyms</span> could be corrupted by 
retention of logically deleted characters.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0113:</b> The <span class="code">spin</span> command was broken
on OS X due to a parochially Linux assumption about the 
<span class="code">errno</span> set by <span class="code">mkdir()</span> 
failure for an already-existing directory.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0114:</b> With the <span class="code">--replace</span> option 
a rewritten input file could have changed permissions.
</li> 
<li><b>DEF0115:</b> Symbols could be prematurely marked up-to-date for 
resolution, causing out-of-date resolved values to be reported with 
<span class="code">symbols --evalsyms</span> or new resolved values to 
go unreported with <span class="code">--once</span>.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0116:</b> Symbols were not reported for symbols 
<span class="code">--evalsyms</span>
when encountered in the resolution of another symbol.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0031:</b> Added option <span class="code">--explain</span> for
the <span class="code">sybols</span> command. In reporting theresolved 
value of a symbol <span class="code">sym</span>, coan will also recursively
report the resolution of each symbol that is resolved in the course of 
resolving <span class="code">sym</span>.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0032:</b> Added option <span class="code">--select name1[*][,name2[*]...]</span>
for the <span class="code">symbols</span> command. Restricts reported 
symbols to those that match one of the listed names or wildcard name prefixes.

<span class="code">#define FOO/*Comment*/</span> or <span class="code">#define MACRO/*Comment*/bar</span>
</li>
<li><b>REW0018:</b> Support for the clang C++ compiler >= v3.1 is introduced.

<p class="section">v5.1.1 Mike Kinghan 2012-04-25</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEF0105:</b> Deletion of superflous parentheses could in some cases
leave no whitespace between a directive keyword and the simplified body of the
directive.</li>
<li><b>DEF0106:</b> The --line option was ineffective in conjunction with
--replace.</li>
<li><b>DEF0107:</b> The --line option was accepted together with either
--discard blank or --discard comment although these pairs of are options are
mutually exclusive.</li>
<li><b>DEF0107:</b> The --discard blank and--discard comment options were
ineffective in the spin command.</li>
<li><b>DEF0108:</b> The parser parameter to stop at a double-quote is set for
parsing #include directives but not cleared when done, so that if a string
literal containing a comment-opener token,	e.g. "/*" is scanned before any
other directive the opening	quote stops the parser and a new scan immediately
commences which detects the opening of a genuine comment. Text is then
erroneously discarded until some condition forces comment-parsing to stop.</li>
</ul>	
<p class="section">Coan v5.1  Mike Kinghan 2012-02-01</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEF0104:</b> The --debug option withdrawn in v5.0 remains documented in the
man page and --help output.</li>
<li><b>FEA0030:</b> An in-source #define SYM or #undef SYM directive is transiently
treated as a -DSYM or -USYM option within the source file where it is
found. Provide an option to suppress this behaviour at the user's risk,
possibly causing coan's keep-or-drop decisions to deviate from those the
preprocessor would make. Requested by Qualcomm UK.</li>
</ul>
<p class="section">Coan v5.0  Mike Kinghan 2011-12-06</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEF0096:</b> Coan will parse without comment and evaluate either of:
<p>1)A boolean disjunction whose first operand is true and whose second
operand is garbage - evaluated as true.</p>
<p>2) A boolean conjunction whose first operand is false and whose second
operand is garbage - evaluated as false. E.g.</p>
<pre>
#if (TRUE_VAL || *!Nonsense%@)
// Keep this code ...
#endif
#if !(FALSE_VAL && *!Nonsense%@)
// Keep this code...
#endif
</pre>
<p>
This occurs because short-cirtcuiting the operator is applied too soon,
when the operation is identified and its first operand evaluated. Both
operands should be parsed and short-circuiting deferred until the
operation is applied.</p>
<p>This bug has existed in every version.</p>
</li>
<li><b>DEF0097:</b> Coan will mis-diagnose a missing right parenthesis in
certain cases when the entire argument of an #if is enclosed in
pathentheses, e.g. the legal code:
<pre>
#define LOCAL_MACRO
#undef UNDEF_LOCAL_MACRO
#if (defined (LOCAL_MACRO) && !defined (UNDEF_LOCAL_MACRO))
does_coan_keep_this_1();
#endif
</pre>
produces the error:
<pre>
line 3: error 0x043b0: Missing ")" in \
"#if (defined (LOCAL_MACRO) && !defined (UNDEF_LOCAL_MACRO))"
</pre>
<p>This occurs because the recursive xpression parser's logic for deleting
redundant parentheses is faulty: it assumes a) that parentheses are
always to be sought for deletion around an expression that, when
simplified, contains no binary operator, and b) that the outermost
parentheses in any such expression must surround it. But both (a) and
(b) are false in the case of defined(NAME) expressions, among others,
which contain no binary operator before or after simplification,
and contain outermost parentheses which do not surround the expression.</p>
<p>
Parentheses are eligible for deletion when they actually become
redundant as a result of eliminating an operand of a binary expression.
In these cases the redundant parentheses *will* surround the simplified
expression, and only in these cases will coan reliably determine the
positions of the parentheses to delete.</p>
<p>
Coan erroneously attempts to delete redundant parentheses, which do not
exist, from around the defined(NAME) operands in the conjunction above,
and	since the limits of the operands are not reliably determined in this
setting, the "outermost" parentheses of the operands are detected and
deleted at the positions marked ^ here:</p>
<pre>
(defined ^LOCAL_MACRO^ && !defined ^UNDEF_LOCAL_MACRO)^
</pre>
<p>
- leaving the rightmost parenthesis of the whole expression unmatched
whenthe parser looks for it next.</p>
<p>
The fix is to avoid attempting to delete redundant parentheses when it
is not actually warranted.</p>
</li>
<li><b>DEF0098:</b> Misevaluation of unary minus on unsigned integer constants,
Sourceforge bug #3440713. The application of unary minus to an unsigned
integer constant, e.g. -2U, is incorrectly evaluated as a negative signed integer.
The result should remain unsigned.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0099:</b>The application of unary minus to an unsigned integer constant,
e.g. -2U, is incorrectly evaluated as a negative signed integer. The result
should remain unsigned.
</li>
<li><b>DEF0100:</b> Coan may crash when processing a #define directive where the
definition of the symbol is continued over multiple lines.
<p>
Coan sizes an initial allocation of heap buffer from the length of the
first line of the definition and then consumes discardable characters
before begining to parse the definition. But If the first line of the
multi-line definition consists only of whitespace and a line-continuation,
then consumption of discardable characters brings parsing to the start of
the next line, which may be longer than the initial buffer, causing
parsing of the next line to overrun the initial heap allocation. A crash
results on the next attempted heap allocation.</p>
<p>
The fix is not to discard any characters before the parsing loop is
entered, since accounting of heap resource is done accurately within it.</p>
</li>
<li><b>DEF0101:</b> Coan fails to terminate a symbol's definition when it is
followed adjacently by a multi-line comment, e.g. in:
<pre>
#define NUM_OF_BITS_FOR_UL_CCCH_MSG_TYPE 0x02/* space before the comment
	or a single line comment and it's OK */
#ifdef FEATURE_MODEM_MBMS
#define NUM_OF_BITS_FOR_DL_MCCH_MSG_TYPE 0x04 /* Number of bits for MCCH
Message type*/
</pre>
<p>
with the effect that the definition of NUM_OF_BITS_FOR_UL_CCCH_MSG_TYPE
is parsed as: "0x02 #ifdef FEATURE_MODEM_MBMS"</p>
<p>
It looks like a parse error but actually isn't. Other examples with
the same feature are parsed correctly. It is caused when the line-buffer
gets reallocated between the calculations of the first and second
pointers that are used to locate the definition in the buffer. This can
result in the calculated length of the definition being arbitrarily
inaccurate.</p>
<p>
The fix to is ensure the delimiting pointers reflect any reallocation of
the line-buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><b>DEF0102:</b> Bug report:
<pre>
#if (T_XXXXX && L_M)
#endif

#if ( T_XXXXX && L_M )
#endif

At the first #if containing the symbol L_M, coan terminates with the error:

Missing ")" in "#if (T_XXXXX && L_M)"
</pre>
This parse error can occur for any symbol beginning with 'L'. Failure to
parse a wide-character constant from that point terminates the parse,
but it should resume from the 'L' to attempt to parse a symbol. 
</li>
<li><b>DEF0103:</b> The "?:" operator is now supported.</li>  

<li><b>FEA0028:</b> Macro-expansion supported. Macro-definitions that are
encountered in source are now parsed and will be used to expand
macro-invocations when evaluating directives. There is no support
for user-defined macros in the commandline options.
</li>
<li><b>FEA0028:</b> A new coan comand `spin' is supported. With the new option
--dir DIRANME, this command acts like the `source' command, with the
addition that all output files are written under the directory DIRNAME

root filesystem.

late when a symbol FOO that is not configured by the commandline is
encountered in an in-source	#define FOO [definition] or #undef FOO that
is eligible for reporting. In this case the	symbol is transiently added
to the defined/undefined symbols table for the course of the file and
the symbol should be evaluated for --evalsyms *after* that has been done,
but it is evaluated beforehand. This bug means that FOO will be reported
for --evalsyms as insoluble, whereas it should be resolved to the value
it assumes from the directive.

<li><b>DEF0059:</b> cpp syntax error diagnostics could contain garbage. When a cpp syntax error was

<li><b>RET0001:</b> Withdraw the <span class="code">--constant {unk|eval[,del]}</span> option and replace it a

depending on the context. Coan ought to find that the expression is simply insoluble,
if it is in fact legal</li>
<li><b>DEF0054:</b> The implementation of preprocessor arithmetic was slapdash. All integer values
were construed as int or else too-big. 'U'/'u' and 'L'/'l' integer type-suffixes were
parsed but ignored. The implementation now correctly construes and calculates with values
of all the C integral types from char through unsigned long long. The integer promotions

<li><b>DEF0050:</b> A missing newline at end of file was diagnosed as an
error if encountered while processing a directive but otherwise not diagnosed
at all. This was illogical as in either case the event indicates that the
file may have been truncated, and in either case it merits only a warning
if nothing else is wrong. The event is now always diagnosed as a warning.</li>

a hex integer constant, rather than a decimal constant, coan would fail to resolve <span class="code">SYM</span>

unnecessary. The anomaly ocurred because <em>eval_symbol()</em> anticipated constant values
only as decimal constants and, upon encountering a hex-prefix <span class="code">"0x"</span> or <span class="code">"OX"</span>
would attempt to parse the token as an expression, invoking <em>eval_table()</em> and ultimately
<em>eval_unary()</em>. The latter function <em>would</em> resolve a hex constant, but only
if <span class="code">--constant</span> eval is in effect, since the function is assumed to operate on source
text rather than on the definiens of <span class="code">-DSYM=VAL</span>. The fix consists in recognising hex

The reason is the same as in bug DEF0041. The fix consists in recording the origin of the text

<p class="section">Sunifdef v1.0</p>
Initial stable release.
<ul>
<li><b>REW0002:</b> The <span class="code">-i | --ignore</span> option is renamed <span class="code">-p | --podsym</span> to indicate
better that the option causes lines to be treated as Plain Old data. The <span class="code">-t | --text</span> option
is renamed <span class="code">-P | --pod</span> for the same reason.</li>
<li><b>REW0003:</b> The implementation of the <span class="code">--constant</span> policy, though consistent, was not
conceptually coherent. Reworked.</li>
<li><b>FEA0006:</b> The <span class="code">-p | --podsym</span> option is honoured for <span class="code">if defined</span>
and <span class="code">if !defined</span> directives as well as <span class="code">ifdef</span> and <span class="code">ifndef</span>.</li>
<li><b>DEF0004:</b> Overlooked occurrence of "unifdef" rather than "sunifdef" in diagnostic output.</li>
<li><b>DEF0005:</b> The dropped lines count was not incremented for conflicts in the presence of the
<span class="code">--conflict delete</span> option.</li>
<li><b>DEF0006:</b> The <span class="code">SUMMARY_ERRORED_LINES</span> status flag (return code &amp; 64) was not set
in respect of the <span class="code">--conflict error</span> option.</li>
<li><b>DEF0007:</b> The <span class="code">--conflict error</span> option was not followed through for the case where
it causes an unconditional error to be output (return code &amp; 128).</li>
<li><b>DEF0009:</b> <span class="code">printline_cut()</span> was capable of leaving non-printable house-keeping bytes
in the tidied up output buffer.</li>
<li><b>DEF0010:</b> The <span class="code">--constant</span> policy should apply to constants only in truth-functional
contexts but was applied in all contexts. In arithmetic contexts constants should always be treated
as integers: the constant policy does not apply.</li>
<li><b>DEF0011:</b> Parentheses rendered redundant by simplification were not deleted in all cases where
they safely could be.</li>
<li><b>TST0001:</b> Automated test framework provided. Executes with <span class="code">make check</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="section">Sunifdef v0.1.4</p>
<p>Bug fix release.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEF0002:</b> <span class="code">memmove()</span> miscalculation could cause seg fault in symbol table lookups.</li>
<li><b>DEF0003:</b> Mis-ordering of insertions into the symbol table could cause lookups to fail erroneously.</li>
