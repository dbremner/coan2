Release 5.2
===========

New Features:
-------------

Added option `--explain` for the `sybols` command. In reporting the
resolved value of a symbol `sym`, coan will also recursively report the 
resolution of each symbol that is resolved in the course of resolving `sym`.

Added option `--select name1[*][,name2[*]...]` for the `sybols` command.
Restricts reported symbols to those that match one of the listed names or 
wildcard name prefixes.

Installing
==========

See the file INSTALL for generic installation guidance.

Note that you must be root to run `make install'.

A successful installation in the default path (/usr/local) will create 2 files:

- The coan executable /usr/local/bin/coan
- The coan man page /usr/local/man/man1/coan.1.gz

You can execute `coan version' at the command prompt to test that coan
is correctly installed, and you can execute `man coan' to test that the man
page is correctly installed.


HTML Documentation
==================
You can view the man page in HTML at http://coan2.sourceforge.net/coan_man_1.html

You can view the maintainer's Doxygen documentation at
http://coan2.sourceforge.net/maintainer-doxygen/

Testing coan
================
There is a test suite in coan/test_coan. The test suite is executed by
`make check'
